Natural Cubic Spline and Discrete Fourier Series for the analysis of the average temperature in a city X

Exploring the Natural Cubic Spline and Discrete Fourier Series for the analysis of the average temperature in a city X. The natural cubic spline is a piecewise interpolation method that differs from polynomial interpolation methods because it is the summation of multiple lower order polynomials that piece together the entire approximation rather than a single, large degree polynomial. This is advantageous because of some problems with polynomial interpolation such as over-fitting, which can lead to unhelpful oscillating behavior in the interpolant.
